# An ASP.NET 4.6 E-Commerce website.
This website project was created on a team of 6 individuals over the course of 6 weeks. This was a remote team created as a Senior Project - the final project before graduating with  a BS in Computer Information Systems. Working in a remote environment on the team required effective communication, effective project management, and clearly outlined goals. We developed this site using an Agile methodology and used Team Foundation Server (now Azure DevOps) to manage team member code. Full files posted can be found on my Github at https://github.com/adrielp/SquawCreek.
