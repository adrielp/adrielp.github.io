# Squaw Creek Golf Course  


An ASP.NET 4.6 E-Commerce website.
This website project was created on a team of 6 individuals over the course of 6 weeks. This was a remote team created as a Senior Project for school. Working in this remote environment on the team required effective communication, effective project management, and clearly outlined goals. We developed this site using an Agile methodology and used Team Foundation Server (now Azure DevOps) to manage team member code. Link to live website can be found here. Full files posted on my Github(no tokens included for live deployment).
