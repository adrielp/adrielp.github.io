# Agency Website Template

### A static, clean, Agency template website.
This website project enhanced two sets of skills. I went through a deep strategic design process to come up with the design. Then I translated the design from Adobe XD into VS Code and utilized SASS for the first time. Thus, I was able to expand my skills in Strategic thinking, Design, and Development with one project. Repo files can be found on my GitHub at https://github.com/adrielp/agencyCreativeStaticWebsite.
