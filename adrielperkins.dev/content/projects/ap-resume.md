Original Personal Resume Website

A simple, static, responsive website.
I originally created this website from scratch to review and enhance my CSS skills. I wanted to learn best practices while coding CSS and specifically approaching the site with a mobile first approach and without a framework. This was a great website just to display my online resume. Full files posted on my Github.
